   <p> So i started my educational career in fountain group of schools back then it was small. I later transfered to Good shepherds academy where i finished my primary educational.

   <img src="images/highschool.webp" alt="school">
   <p > My highschool life was pretty intresting. I was admitted at MARY MOTHER OF GRACE. At first it has hectic and later in Form 1 i rose to power. I started of as Dinning hall captain FORM 1-2 then in FORM 3-4 i was elected as the school captain . I know right unbelivable.
    I asked myself whether life is on our hands or we just flow with what comes.
   </p>
<P>Why is it i choose to do programming? Well for me is passion . I started reserching about programming when i was in class 6.Since then i have always known i want to be a developer. Actually i thought knowing programming would make
    me invisible like as a hacker or sought of.
